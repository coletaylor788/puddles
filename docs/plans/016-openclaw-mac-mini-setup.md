# OpenClaw Mac Mini Setup Plan

## Overview
Set up OpenClaw on a Mac Mini (M4) with native Apple integrations (iMessage, Calendar, Reminders, Contacts), proper sandbox + tool gate architecture, and hardened network security.

## Current State (Updated April 19, 2026 — evening)

**Phase 1 complete.** Mac Mini is fully provisioned as a headless server with:
- Two-account separation (cole admin / puddles agent)
- Secure Enclave SSH keys (Touch ID) for both accounts, on both LAN and Tailscale paths
- VLAN-isolated networking, Tailscale always-on (system LaunchDaemon)
- FileVault enabled, validated two-step remote unlock (MacBook script + iPhone Termius one-tap)
- Weekly automated `brew upgrade` (system LaunchDaemon as cole)
- iCloud Drive (Desktop & Documents Folders) signed in as puddles for data backup
  - **Optimize Mac Storage: OFF** — keeps full file contents on disk so containers reading bind-mounted iCloud paths get real files, not `.icloud` placeholder stubs

Setup procedure captured end-to-end in `docs/openclaw-setup/01-setting-up-your-mac-mini.md`. Below is the live state reference.


### Accounts
- **cole** — admin account, local only (no Apple ID), used for system management and sudo operations
  - Apple ID was initially signed in, then removed to minimize attack surface
  - No personal data stored on this account
- **puddles** — standard (non-admin) account with his own Apple ID, runs OpenClaw and all agent services
  - Separate Apple ID for iMessage, Calendar, Reminders, Contacts
  - **Primary remote-unlock user**: his password unlocks FileVault and logs him in in one step (see 6.2)

### SSH Access
- Secure Enclave SSH keys (ECDSA P-256, Touch ID per connection) configured for both accounts
  - Key created via `sc_auth create-ctk-identity` with `-t bio` (biometric required)
  - Key handle exported via `ssh-keygen -w /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib -K`
  - `SSH_SK_PROVIDER=/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib` set in `~/.zshrc`
  - Private key is hardware-bound (never leaves Secure Enclave, cannot be extracted)
  - Same key authenticates to both cole and puddles accounts
- Termius on iPhone (free tier) holds the unlock password in iOS Keychain, Face ID gated — used for pre-login FileVault unlock over LAN

### Networking
- VLAN "Puddles-Pond" (192.168.8.0/24) on UniFi Dream Machine
- DHCP reservation: 192.168.8.230 (ethernet)
- Hostname: Coles-Mac-mini.local
- **WiFi disabled entirely** — ethernet only (required for pre-login SSH unlock; reduces attack surface)
- **Local firewall**: SSH (22) on LAN reachable via inter-VLAN allow rule (working). Screen Sharing (5900) on LAN currently blocked — UniFi rule format quirk being investigated. Tailscale path always works for both.
- Puddles-Pond → all other VLANs: blocked (Drop)
- Default → Puddles-Pond: explicit allow rule for SSH/VNC ports (so MacBook on default VLAN can unlock the box on home LAN)

### Tailscale
- Installed via Homebrew CLI (v1.96.4) — NOT App Store (GUI is sandboxed, can't host SSH)
- Running as system LaunchDaemon (`sudo brew services start tailscale`) — starts at boot before login
- Tailscale SSH enabled (`tailscale up --ssh`)
- Key expiry disabled for this device
- Tailnet hostname: `coles-mac-mini-1` (Tailscale IP: 100.66.225.105)
- Tagged as `tag:agent` in Tailscale ACLs
- ACL policy: personal devices → agent allowed, agent → personal devices blocked
- Screen Sharing accessible via `vnc://coles-mac-mini-1`
- Auto-update not supported on Homebrew install — weekly `brew upgrade` cron to be set up

### Installed Software
- Homebrew 5.1.6
- Node.js 22 (via Homebrew)
- Git (via Homebrew)
- Tailscale 1.96.4 (via Homebrew)

## Approach
Execute setup in phases, each building on the last. All commands run as the `puddles` user via SSH unless noted otherwise.

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### 1.1 — Install Homebrew
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### 1.2 — Install Tailscale (Homebrew CLI, NOT App Store)
```bash
brew install tailscale
brew services start tailscale
sudo tailscale up --ssh
```
- Authenticate via printed URL
- Tag as `tag:agent` in Tailscale ACLs — no outbound to personal devices
- Keep macOS sshd as fallback until Tailscale proven stable across reboots
- Once stable: close local firewall ports, re-enable VLAN isolation

### 1.3 — Install Node.js 22 + Git
```bash
brew install node@22 git
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin:$PATH"
```

---

## Phase 2: OpenClaw

**Status: ✅ fully set up as of April 21, 2026 evening.** Just needs the in-UI bootstrap ritual to complete.

### Final state
- SIP disabled (Recovery → `csrutil disable`) — risk accepted, see Security Architecture
- Library validation disabled (`DisableLibraryValidation = 1`)
- **OpenClaw 2026.4.21** installed globally as **cole** (`npm install -g openclaw@latest`); puddles uses the binary at `/opt/homebrew/bin/openclaw` — no per-user npm prefix needed. Updates must be run as cole (puddles can't write to `/opt/homebrew/lib`).
- Tailscale **operator = puddles** (`sudo tailscale set --operator=puddles`) so puddles can manage `tailscale serve` without sudo
- Onboarded with **the configured LLM provider** as model provider (OAuth, token at `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`)
- Default model: **`<your-provider>/<your-model-id>`** (1M context Opus via the provider)
- Soft compaction budget: **600,000 tokens** (`agents.defaults.contextTokens = 600000`, ~60% of model ceiling)
- Reasoning effort: **high** (`agents.defaults.thinkingDefault = high`) — initially set to `adaptive` but the provider's Claude proxy doesn't expose adaptive (UI dropdown for Claude Opus 4.6 only shows Off/Minimal/Low/Medium/High; "Default" resolves to low). Set to `high` so Opus reasons hard by default; dial down per-message in the composer when you want speed.
- Gateway running as puddles' LaunchAgent on `127.0.0.1:18789` (`gateway.mode=local`)
- **Tailscale Serve** active: `https://coles-mac-mini-1.tailcef8bc.ts.net/` → proxies to `127.0.0.1:18789`. Tailnet-only HTTPS (real cert). NOT funnelled.
- `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins = ["https://coles-mac-mini-1.tailcef8bc.ts.net"]` so the browser origin is permitted
- `plugins.entries.device-pair.config.publicUrl = "https://coles-mac-mini-1.tailcef8bc.ts.net"` so QR/setup-codes advertise the tailnet URL
- Browser + CLI both **paired** (via `openclaw devices approve`). Used the gateway auth token from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (`gateway.auth.token`).
- Smoke-tested: agent reply via Opus 4.6 ✅
- BOOTSTRAP.md (`~/.openclaw/workspace/BOOTSTRAP.md`) **pending** — first-wake interview happens in browser UI; agent will populate IDENTITY.md / USER.md / SOUL.md, then delete BOOTSTRAP.md

### 2.x — Gotchas captured this round (for guide #02)
1. **Wizard is fragile when interrupted.** It writes config in stages (auth → gateway.mode → daemon → per-agent models). Killing it mid-flow leaves partial state. Recovery: `openclaw config set gateway.mode local && openclaw daemon install && openclaw daemon start`.
2. **Driving the wizard via async/SSH is bad** — the spinner output (`◒ ◐ ◓ ◑`) floods buffers and blanks the TUI. Either run it in a real terminal (Termius / VNC GUI) or use `--non-interactive` flags where supported.
3. **`--non-interactive` does NOT support the configured LLM provider:** `openclaw onboard --non-interactive --auth-choice <your-provider> ...` → "the configured LLM provider provider plugin does not implement non-interactive setup." Must onboard interactively for this provider.
4. **`gpt-5.4` (the current default in shipped models.json) is mapped to provider `codex`**, not your provider. After provider-only onboard, change the default with: `openclaw config set agents.defaults.model "<your-provider>/<your-model-id>"` then `openclaw daemon restart`.
5. **CLI ↔ gateway pairing required after first browser pair.** `openclaw devices approve <requestId> --token <gateway.auth.token>` for both. The CLI shows up as pending request with `device=agent`; the browser shows up with a long hex device id.
6. **`openclaw infer model providers`** is the way to inspect what's wired up (per-provider count/defaults/configured/selected). `openclaw infer model list` to see all models with provider+context-window. Use `openclaw infer model inspect --model <provider/model>` to confirm context window.
7. **The `(200k ctx)` in `openclaw status` is NOT the model ceiling** — it's `sessions.defaults.contextTokens` (soft compaction budget). The model's true context window comes from `models.providers.<id>.models[].contextWindow` and is shown by `infer model inspect`.
8. **Tailscale Serve must be enabled at tailnet level first** (one-time, free) at `login.tailscale.com/f/serve?node=...`. Enable HTTPS/Serve only — NOT Funnel.
9. **`tailscale serve` config errors are descriptive**: `Origin not allowed` → set `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins`; `pairing required` → approve via `openclaw devices approve`.
10. **`openclaw config set` for arrays needs `--json`**: e.g. `openclaw config set gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins --json '["https://..."]'`. Plain string fails validation.
11. **OpenClaw updates: run as the install owner (cole).** `ssh cole@... 'npm install -g openclaw@latest'`. Then `ssh puddles@... 'openclaw daemon restart'`. UI-triggered update fails because daemon process (puddles) can't write to cole's brew prefix.

### 2.3 — Configure Telegram channel (deferred — not blocking BlueBubbles)
- Migrate config from Azure instance

### 2.4 — Pair CLI to gateway via daemon (DONE)
- See "Final state" above. Both browser + CLI paired.

### 2.5 — Loose ends fixed before BlueBubbles (DONE)
- ✅ `device-pair` plugin formally enabled: `openclaw config set plugins.entries.device-pair.enabled true` (silences config warning)
- ✅ `gateway.trustedProxies = ["127.0.0.1/32", "::1/128"]` so Tailscale Serve's loopback hop is trusted
- ✅ `openclaw security audit` → **0 critical · 0 warn**

### 2.6 — UI thinking-effort label cosmetic bug (TODO: confirm + report)
- Symptom: composer dropdown for `Claude Opus 4.6 · <your-provider>` shows **"Default (low)"** even with `agents.list[main].thinkingDefault = "high"` and `agents.defaults.thinkingDefault = "high"` set.
- Root cause: in `dist/control-ui/assets/index-Bsj0vinf.js` the `ja(provider, model, catalog)` function hardcodes the default-label as `adaptive` for `provider=anthropic` (regex-matched Claude) or `provider=amazon-bedrock` Claude, else `low` for any other reasoning model. It does NOT consult agent config for the label.
- The runtime resolver (`dist/model-selection-DpNW4nwC.js`: `agentEntry?.thinkingDefault ?? resolved ?? agentCfg?.thinkingDefault ?? "off"`) should still apply our `high` default.
- **TODO:** confirm via inspecting an actual request payload (e.g. `openclaw logs`, or send a complex prompt and verify reasoning depth). If not actually applied, file as bug + workaround = manually pick "High" per session.
- **TODO:** open OpenClaw issue: UI label should fall back to `agentEntry.thinkingDefault` for non-anthropic-direct providers (especially third-party Claude proxies).

---

## Phase 3: iMessage + BlueBubbles

**Status: starting now (April 21, 2026 evening). SIP + libval already done in Phase 2.**

### 3.1 — Disable SIP (DONE in Phase 2)
### 3.2 — Disable library validation (DONE in Phase 2)

### 3.3 — Install BlueBubbles
```bash
brew install --cask bluebubbles
```
- Grant Full Disk Access + Accessibility in System Settings (via Screen Sharing)
- Set strong API password
- Enable Private API (typing indicators, read receipts, tapbacks, reply threading)
- Enable auto-start on login

### 3.4 — Connect BlueBubbles to OpenClaw
```bash
openclaw channels add --channel bluebubbles \
  --http-url http://127.0.0.1:1234 \
  --password "PASSWORD" \
  --webhook-path /bluebubbles-webhook
```

### 3.5 — Set DM policy
```bash
openclaw config set channels.bluebubbles.dmPolicy allowlist
openclaw config set 'channels.bluebubbles.allowFrom' '["+1COLE_PHONE"]'
```

### 3.6 — Onboarding new people
Wraps Puddles for use with people other than Cole. Moved to **Phase 8: Multiplayer** below — out of scope for the single-user MVP.

---

## Phase 4: Apple PIM (Calendars, Reminders, Contacts)

### 4.1 — Install Apple PIM Agent Plugin
- Repo: https://github.com/omarshahine/Apple-PIM-Agent-Plugin
- Swift CLIs: `calendar-cli`, `reminder-cli`, `contacts-cli`
- Runs natively via EventKit — no cloud API needed
- First run: approve macOS TCC permission dialogs via Screen Sharing

### 4.2 — Share calendars/reminders from Cole → Puddles
- Calendar app → right-click calendar → Share → Puddles' Apple ID
- Reminders app → right-click list → Share → Puddles' Apple ID
- Accept sharing invitations on the Mac Mini

---

## Phase 5: Docker + Sandboxing

### 5.1 — Install Docker Desktop
```bash
brew install --cask docker
```
- Enable "Start on login"
- Used for sandboxed agents (restricted agents run in Docker containers)

### 5.2 — Container ↔ host filesystem architecture (decisions)

**iCloud lives on the macOS host, not inside containers.** Linux containers reach in via bind mounts (for files) or host-side bridges (for Apple APIs).

**Mount layout (planned for guide #02 / docker-compose):**

| Host path | Container path | Mode | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `~/Documents/puddles/` | `/workspace/` | rw | Agent's working dir; `soul.md`, projects/, inbox/, journal/ live here. iCloud-synced via host's `bird` daemon. |
| `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/` | `/icloud/` | rw, optional | If agent needs broader iCloud Drive access beyond `~/Documents/puddles/`. |
| (Calendar / Reminders / Contacts / Notes) | — | — | NOT mounted. Reached via Apple PIM bridge plugin (Phase 4). |

**Browser container** gets a much narrower mount surface:
- `/downloads/` ← `~/Documents/puddles/inbox/browser-downloads/`
- `/uploads/` ← staging dir agent writes to
- NO `/workspace/` mount; NO soul.md access. Browser container is the most-untrusted thing in the stack.

**Sync semantics:**
- Container writes `/workspace/file.md` → bind-mount → APFS → host's `bird` daemon uploads to iCloud → visible on phone/MacBook in seconds
- Container reads `/workspace/file.md` → file is fully present on disk (because Optimize Mac Storage is OFF in §1.x — see Current State)

**Deferred (low-priority gotchas, document if they bite us):**
- File ownership / UID mapping (Docker Desktop on Mac handles transparently via virtio-fs in most cases)
- `.DS_Store` files in agent file walks
- Spotlight indexing of high-churn cache dirs (`mdutil -i off ~/Documents/puddles/cache/` if needed)

### 5.3 — Per-agent absolute tool allowlists ✅ (2026-04-24)

Switched from a single `tools.sandbox.tools.alsoAllow` punch-hole to absolute per-agent `agents.list[].tools.allow` lists. Anything not in the list is denied — no deny-list maintenance.

**Four-agent split (all on `claude-opus-4.6`):**

| agent | sandbox | allowlist | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **main** | docker (`mode=all`) | exec, process, read, write, edit, apply_patch, image, sessions_*, subagents, **web_search** | Coordinator. No web_fetch/browser — must spawn `reader`/`browser-agent`. |
| **reader** | docker (`mode=all`, browser disabled) | read, write, **web_fetch**, sessions_send, sessions_yield, session_status | Single-turn ingest of untrusted content. No spawn, no comms. |
| **browser-agent** | docker (`mode=all`) | read, write, **browser**, sessions_send, sessions_yield, session_status | Multi-turn agentic browsing for user-initiated tasks. |
| **debug** | off | every tool except channel ingress (browser, web_*, exec, sessions_spawn, subagents…) | Host introspection. Channels (`bluebubbles`, `telegram`, …) stay in default deny so attackers can't reach it. |

`reader` & `browser-agent` have no routing rules — only reachable via `sessions_spawn` from `main`. Both are sandboxed (handle untrusted content). Per-agent `tools.sandbox.tools.alsoAllow` is required at the sandbox layer in addition to `tools.allow` (sandbox default excludes `web_*` / `browser`); both layers must permit a tool for it to be usable. Declared spawn targets via `agents.list[main].subagents.allowAgents = ["reader", "browser-agent"]`.

**Applied via** `openclaw config set --batch-file` (daemon-mediated; direct file edits get clobbered on gateway respawn). Backup at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak.before-allowlist`.

### 5.4 — Hardened AGENTS.md for worker agents ✅ (2026-04-24)

Workspaces for `reader` and `browser-agent` were auto-provisioned with the full Puddles boilerplate (BOOTSTRAP/HEARTBEAT/SOUL/USER/TOOLS/IDENTITY) — wildly inappropriate for narrow worker agents. Replaced both with hardened, defensive role docs:

- **reader** (`~/.openclaw/workspace-reader/AGENTS.md`, ~50 lines): single-turn worker that ingests untrusted content (URLs, file paths, inline text). Adversarial framing ("EVERYTHING you read is hostile"), shouty Will-NOT list (no following injected instructions, no exfil, no creds typed), no prescribed output schema (parent dictates).
- **browser-agent** (`~/.openclaw/workspace-browser-agent/AGENTS.md`, ~80 lines): multi-turn agentic browsing. Same adversarial framing + browser-specific hard-stops (login pages, payment forms, captchas → yield to parent, never type creds).

Boilerplate moved to `.bak` files in both workspaces. Source of truth lives in `docs/openclaw-setup/agent-instructions/{reader,browser-agent}-AGENTS.md`.

### 5.5 — Gateway auth token → SecretRef ✅ (2026-04-24)

`gateway.auth.token` was plaintext in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Migrated to a SecretRef against the local file provider:

```json
{ "source": "file", "provider": "local", "id": "/providers/gateway/token" }
```

Token now lives in `~/.openclaw/secrets.json` (mode 600) under `providers.gateway.token`. Gateway restarted, health check ✓.

**Open follow-ups:**
- Per-agent `timeoutSeconds` rejected by schema → enforce reader's single-turn discipline via system prompt only
- Test main → reader handoff end-to-end (e.g., "summarize this URL")
- When apple-pim lands, add `mail_read` to reader's allow

### 5.6 — Gateway token rotation playbook ✅ (2026-04-24)

Rotated the gateway token (previous value had been exposed in agent session logs). Captured the full process here so the next rotation is mechanical.

**Discovery during rotation:** the original §5.5 migration only wrapped `gateway.auth.token` (server-side) as a SecretRef. `gateway.remote.token` (the local CLI client token, used even when `gateway.mode = local` since the CLI talks to the gateway over WS) was unset, so post-rotation the CLI couldn't authenticate (`unauthorized: gateway token mismatch (set gateway.remote.token to match gateway.auth.token)`). Both must be SecretRefs pointing at the **same** secret entry — otherwise rotations require updating two places and clients drift.

After this fix, both keys reference `providers.gateway.token`:

```json
"gateway": {
  "auth":   { "token": { "source": "file", "provider": "local", "id": "/providers/gateway/token" } },
  "remote": { "token": { "source": "file", "provider": "local", "id": "/providers/gateway/token" } }
}
```

**Rotation steps (one secret, no config edits needed):**

1. SSH to mini (`ssh puddles@coles-mac-mini`).
2. Atomically replace `providers.gateway.token` in `~/.openclaw/secrets.json` with a new 32-byte hex value (back up first to `secrets.json.bak.<timestamp>`, write to a temp file, `chmod 600`, `os.replace`).
3. `openclaw secrets reload` — re-resolves SecretRefs and atomically swaps the runtime snapshot. **No process restart needed.** The long-running gateway picks up the new token in place.
4. Verify: `openclaw gateway call health` (CLI uses the new token end-to-end via `gateway.remote.token`).

The `secrets reload` warning count is unrelated — `openclaw secrets audit` lists pre-existing plaintext findings (currently 3 × LLM provider tokens in `~/.openclaw/agents/{main,browser-agent,reader}/agent/auth-profiles.json`). Tracked as a separate follow-up below.

**Operational notes:**
- `~/.openclaw/secrets.json` contains plaintext credentials — do not `cat` it during rotations or troubleshooting; only update by atomic write or `chmod`/`ls -la` to verify perms.
- `openclaw config get` redacts known sensitive keys (e.g., `gateway.*.token`) regardless of whether the underlying value is plaintext or a SecretRef. Don't infer SecretRef vs plaintext from the redacted display — inspect the JSON shape directly.
- Gateway runs as a system LaunchDaemon (`/Library/LaunchDaemons/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist`, label `ai.openclaw.gateway`, runs as `puddles`). **`openclaw gateway status` misleadingly reports `Service: LaunchAgent (not loaded)` because it only inspects the user-LaunchAgent slot — ignore that line.** Source-of-truth is `launchctl print system/ai.openclaw.gateway` (no sudo needed for this subcommand) or `pgrep -fla openclaw-gateway`.

**SSH access from laptop (separate gotcha discovered):**
- The laptop's only SSH key is a FIDO2 security-key-resident key (`~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk_rk`). macOS system OpenSSH (`/usr/bin/ssh`) does not enable security-key support unless `SSH_SK_PROVIDER` is set. With macOS's built-in middleware: `export SSH_SK_PROVIDER=/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib` (already set in `~/.zshrc` for interactive shells, but **not inherited by non-interactive subprocess shells** — set it explicitly when scripting SSH).
- For repeated commands without re-tapping the key on every connection, use SSH ControlMaster:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.ssh/cm
  ssh -o ControlMaster=yes -o ControlPath=~/.ssh/cm/%r@%h:%p -o ControlPersist=2h -fN puddles@coles-mac-mini
  # subsequent calls reuse the master:
  ssh -o ControlPath=~/.ssh/cm/%r@%h:%p puddles@coles-mac-mini '<cmd>'
  ```

**Open follow-ups (post-rotation):**
- Consider adding `SSH_SK_PROVIDER` to `~/.zshenv` (loaded by non-interactive shells) so scripted SSH from the laptop "just works" without per-call exports.

### 5.7 — LLM provider OAuth tokens → SecretRef ✅ (2026-04-24)

Audit (`openclaw secrets audit`) flagged 3 plaintext provider OAuth tokens in agent auth-profiles:
- `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`
- `~/.openclaw/agents/browser-agent/agent/auth-profiles.json`
- `~/.openclaw/agents/reader/agent/auth-profiles.json`

All three were verified identical (same SHA-256), so consolidated into a single secrets entry rather than per-agent copies.

**Result:**
- `~/.openclaw/secrets.json` gained `providers.<your-provider>.token` (the canonical token, mode 600).
- Each `auth-profiles.json` token field replaced with:
  ```json
  { "source": "file", "provider": "local", "id": "/providers/<your-provider>/token" }
  ```
- Backups of all 4 modified files written alongside as `*.bak.<timestamp>`.
- Post-migration: `openclaw secrets audit` → **clean. plaintext=0, unresolved=0, shadowed=0, legacy=0.**

**Lingering benign warning:** `secrets reload` reports `1 warning(s)`. The detail is `[SECRETS_REF_IGNORED_INACTIVE_SURFACE] gateway.remote.token: gateway.auth.token is configured.` — when `gateway.mode = local`, the gateway server resolves its own auth from `gateway.auth.token` and considers the `remote.token` "inactive on the auth surface". The CLI client still reads `remote.token` to authenticate over WS, so the SecretRef must remain set. Misleading wording from openclaw; flow is correct end-to-end and verified by `openclaw gateway call health`.

## Phase 6: macOS Hardening

### 6.1 — Headless reliability checklist ("shit just works")

**Energy & Startup (Settings → Energy):**
- Prevent automatic sleeping when display is off
- Start up automatically after power failure
- Wake for network access (enables Wake-on-LAN over ethernet)
- Display sleep: 10 min ok (irrelevant headless)
- Kernel-panic auto-restart: on by default on Apple Silicon. The `sudo systemsetup -setrestartfreeze on` command (covers soft hangs) returns error -99 unless Terminal has Full Disk Access; skip it unless you specifically want this

**Lock Screen (Settings → Lock Screen):**
- "Require password after screen saver begins or display is turned off" → **Immediately** (or 5s)
- "Start Screen Saver when inactive" → 5 min
- "Turn display off when inactive" → 5–10 min
- "Login window shows" → **Name and password** (not user list — minor hardening)
- **Why lock?** Background services run regardless of lock state. Locking just protects the physical box if someone walks up.

**Network (Settings → Network):**
- WiFi → **Off entirely**, uncheck "Ask to join networks" (ethernet only — prevents fallback if cable yanked, reduces attack surface, required for pre-login SSH unlock)
- Confirm DHCP reservation in UniFi (`192.168.8.230`)
- Hostname: verify `Coles-Mac-mini` via `scutil --get HostName` (set with `sudo scutil --set HostName ...` if needed)

**Sharing (Settings → General → Sharing):**
- ✅ Screen Sharing
- ✅ Remote Login (SSH) — "Only these users" → cole, puddles
- ❌ Everything else (File, Media, Printer, Remote Management, Internet)

**puddles user session settings (apply by Screen Sharing in as puddles):**
- Notifications → **Do Not Disturb always on** (no popups eating Screen Sharing focus)
- Disable **Apple Intelligence / Siri**
- Disable **Spotlight web search/suggestions**
- Disable **Analytics & Improvements / Share with App Developers**
- Disable **AirDrop / Handoff**

**Login Items for puddles** (set up later as services come online):
- Tailscale (already system LaunchDaemon — runs at boot regardless of login)
- BlueBubbles
- OpenClaw agent
- Any other agent services
- **Pattern preference:** Prefer **system LaunchDaemons in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`** over per-user LaunchAgents. Daemons run at boot independent of who's logged in (or whether anyone is). Only use LaunchAgents for things that genuinely need the user GUI session.

**Headless display quirk:**
- Without an HDMI display attached, Mac Mini may boot at 640×480 and Screen Sharing inherits that low resolution
- Either: keep an **HDMI dummy plug** attached, OR use [`displayplacer`](https://github.com/jakehilborn/displayplacer) to force a sensible resolution at login

**Recovery / theft protection on Apple Silicon:**
- True "Recovery Lock" as a discrete toggle is MDM-only on Apple Silicon
- For non-MDM Macs, **FileVault provides the equivalent protection automatically** — entering Recovery (or installing macOS, or wiping) requires the **owner credential** of a FileVault-enabled user. So enabling FileVault (next section) covers this for free
- (Old plans referenced `sudo bputil -E` — that flag does not exist; `bputil` exposes low-level boot policy and is not needed for our setup)

### 6.1.1 — macOS update strategy (unattended where safe)

**Auto-install: ON for safe categories**
- Settings → General → Software Update → Automatic Updates (gear icon):
  - ✅ Check for updates
  - ✅ Download new updates when available
  - ✅ Install Security Responses and system files (no reboot, low risk)
  - ❌ Install macOS updates (we control reboot timing)
  - ❌ Install application updates from the App Store (control)

**Manual but unattended-after-trigger workflow:**

For point releases (e.g. 26.1 → 26.2), use `softwareupdate` with `--user`/`--stdinpass` to leverage `fdesetup authrestart` — installs, reboots, FileVault auto-unlocks the one time, puddles auto-logs-in:

```bash
# Pipe password from Keychain so it never appears on screen or in history
security find-generic-password -a cole -s "macmini-admin" -w | \
  sudo softwareupdate --install --all --restart --user cole --stdinpass
```

Caveats:
- Requires cole to be a FileVault-enabled secure-token holder (default for primary admin)
- `authrestart` is **single-use** — multi-reboot updates will halt at FileVault for the second reboot
- **Do NOT auto-apply major OS upgrades** (e.g. Tahoe → next year's release). Trigger those manually with a window for handholding

**Notification of available updates:**
- Apple's built-in update notifications go to Notification Center on the logged-in user's screen → useless for headless
- Deferred to Phase 7 (see 7.1) — Puddles will check periodically and notify via his own channels

### 6.1.2 — Health monitoring
- Simple heartbeat: cron on puddles hits a private endpoint (e.g. `ntfy.sh/private-topic` or your own webhook) every N minutes
- Alert if heartbeat missed for X minutes — early warning for "Mac Mini is down"
- Can also be folded into Puddles' own self-monitoring once he's up

### 6.1.3 — BlueBubbles self-healing (DONE 2026-04-23)
Inspired by https://lobster.shahine.com/guides/bluebubbles-health/ but reverse-engineered (lobster scripts are private). Three scripts in `~/.openclaw/bin/` on puddles:

- **`bb-healthcheck.sh`** (read-only): BB process alive, port 1234 listening, authed `/api/v1/ping` returns 200, gateway healthz 200, webhook URL in `config.db` has `?password=`, no recent `webhook rejected.*unauthor` log lines, no stuck BB sessions. Messages.app AppleScript bridge is checked but treated as informational only — BB Private API uses an injected helper bundle, not AppleScript, so an unresponsive bridge does NOT mean BB is broken.
- **`stuck-session-watchdog.sh`** (read-only): scans last 5 `embedded run start.*messageChannel=bluebubbles` log entries, flags any without matching `embedded run end/done/finish` older than 180s (matches `agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds`).
- **`bb-selfheal.sh`** (mutates state): runs healthcheck, applies fixes — restart BlueBubbles if process dead or port not listening, sqlite UPDATE webhook URL if drifted, kill gateway pid (KeepAlive respawns) if healthz down or watchdog tripped — then re-runs healthcheck.

**Schedule:** `/Library/LaunchDaemons/ai.openclaw.bb-selfheal.plist`, runs as `puddles`, `StartInterval=900` (15 min), `RunAtLoad=true`, logs to `~/.openclaw/logs/bb-health/selfheal.log`.

**Tested:** happy path (no-op when healthy ✓), webhook drift repair (fake config.db with wrong URL → script sqlite-updates to correct URL ✓), all three scripts pass `bash -n`.

**Note:** macOS lacks `timeout`; use `perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV' 5 <cmd>` and run inside `bash -c '...' 2>/dev/null` to suppress SIGALRM job-status noise.

### 6.1.4 — Gateway silent-wedge watchdog (TODO)

**Trigger:** 2026-04-26 evening incident — initially diagnosed as transient network blip during a scheduled LLM provider OAuth refresh (18:18 PDT). Refresh failed twice with a connect timeout to the provider's auth endpoint, scheduled-retry never recovered, gateway stayed `state=running` for ~12 hours but processed **zero agent runs** while continuing to accept BlueBubbles webhooks. Discovered next morning when DMs got no reply. `launchctl kickstart -k` recovered it instantly.

**Real root cause (later discovery):** A second wedge on 2026-04-27 morning showed the same symptoms but with a clear fingerprint — `embedded run tool start: tool=list_emails` with no matching `tool end`, and `~/.openclaw/logs/secure-gmail-audit.jsonl` not updated. The actual culprit was the `gmail-mcp` Python bridge: blocking `googleapiclient.execute()` calls inside `async def` handlers with no socket timeout. A hung Google API call froze the bridge's asyncio event loop, which made the gateway appear wedged. Fixed in `servers/gmail-mcp/docs/plans/009-async-bridge-resilience.md` (`asyncio.to_thread` + `httplib2` 30s socket timeout + 60s asyncio timeout + structured logging).

**Why existing health-monitor missed it:** OpenClaw's built-in `[health-monitor]` runs every 300s and checks plumbing (channels connected, plugins loaded) but doesn't detect "auth subsystem dead," "bridge process wedged," or "webhooks accepted but no runs starting."

**Watchdog is now defense-in-depth, not the primary fix.** Plan 009 prevents the specific gmail-mcp wedge. The watchdog still catches:
- Other bridges hanging on their own blocking I/O.
- Auth-subsystem failures (the original 18:18 hypothesis was probably correct as a contributing factor — `Runtime auth refresh failed` did precede both incidents).
- Generic "webhooks accepted but no runs starting" patterns from unknown future causes.

**Plan:** new script `~/.openclaw/bin/gateway-stall-watchdog.sh` on the mini.
- Read-only check: parse `~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log` for the most recent `embedded run start` and the most recent `bluebubbles webhook accepted`. If a webhook was accepted >5 min ago AND no `embedded run start` followed it, the gateway is wedged.
- Also flag standalone signal: `Runtime auth refresh failed` in last 30 min with no subsequent `Runtime auth refreshed for <provider>` success.
- Mutating: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.openclaw.gateway`, then re-check after 30s.
- Schedule: `/Library/LaunchDaemons/ai.openclaw.gateway-stall-watchdog.plist`, `StartInterval=600` (10 min), runs as `puddles`, logs to `~/.openclaw/logs/gateway-stall/`.

**Upstream first:** before deploying the watchdog, check whether `openclaw update` (currently v2026.4.21 → latest v2026.4.25 as of 2026-04-27) fixes the auth-retry bug. If yes, the watchdog is still worth deploying as defense-in-depth — silent-wedge can come from many sources, not just auth.

**Also file OpenClaw issues:**
- "scheduled-retry auth refresh gives up after one attempt; gateway becomes silent black hole accepting webhooks while processing nothing; health-monitor doesn't detect auth-subsystem death"
- "secure-gmail (and other bridge wraps) should enforce a per-call timeout on bridge stdio responses; today a wedged bridge wedges the wrap forever with no audit row"

### 6.2 — FileVault + remote unlock (architecture)

**Why FileVault is now viable for a headless server:** macOS Tahoe 26 added "lightweight SSH" pre-user-login. After reboot, the box halts at FileVault unlock, but sshd responds with `"This system is locked. To unlock it, use a local account name and password"`. Entering a FileVault-enabled user's password completes the boot.

**Critical realization — pre-login SSH only unlocks the disk, NOT a GUI session:**
- Termius/SSH unlock on Tahoe completes FileVault disk unlock and lets boot proceed, but the box parks at **loginwindow** waiting for someone — no user is actually logged in
- Verified empirically: post-Termius-unlock, `who` is empty, `/dev/console` is owned by `root` (loginwindow), `launchctl print gui/<uid>` returns "Domain does not support specified action"
- **System LaunchDaemons** in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` (e.g. Tailscale) DO start at boot regardless — that's why Tailscale comes back online without anyone logging in
- **per-user LaunchAgents** (anything depending on `Messages.app`, Apple ID Keychain, GUI frameworks — i.e. BlueBubbles) require a real GUI login to fire

**The two-step unlock flow (required for full service start):**
1. **Termius (SSH) → puddles@192.168.8.230 → enter password** — completes FileVault unlock, boot continues to loginwindow
2. **VNC client (Jump Desktop / RealVNC / Screens) → vnc://192.168.8.230 → enter VNC password → click puddles → enter macOS password** — creates the GUI session, LaunchAgents fire
3. Disconnect both. The GUI session persists until reboot — reconnects go straight to puddles' desktop, no re-login

Both steps use puddles' password. The first is for FileVault disk unlock, the second is for actual user login. Once logged in, the session sticks for the entire uptime.

**Architecture choice — FileVault unlock is NOT auto-login:**
- On Apple Silicon with FileVault enabled, **GUI auto-login is impossible** by design (`sysadminctl -autologin set` and the GUI both refuse: *"Automatic login is disabled because FileVault is enabled"*)
- The pre-login SSH unlock path is admin-credential-only at the SSH layer; it doesn't initiate a `loginwindow` login
- cole's password ALSO works for SSH unlock (good for emergency / physical access). For the GUI step, log in as puddles so his LaunchAgents start
- Both users must be FileVault-enabled secure-token holders (verified via `sudo fdesetup list`)

**Implication for service architecture:**
- **System LaunchDaemons** (`/Library/LaunchDaemons/`) start at boot regardless of who logs in — best for always-on services (Tailscale daemon already does this). After Termius unlock alone, daemons are up
- **puddles' LaunchAgents** (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`) fire when puddles GUI-logs-in — required for things needing his Apple ID / Keychain / Messages.app (BlueBubbles, iMessage tooling)
- This dual pattern means power outage → Termius unlock → daemons up → VNC GUI login as puddles → agents up → fully operational

**Setup:**
- Enable FileVault: System Settings → Privacy & Security → FileVault → Turn On
  - Enable BOTH cole and puddles when prompted
  - Recovery key: store in **1Password** (NOT iCloud, since cole has no Apple ID)
- Verify Remote Login (SSH) is enabled — required for pre-login SSH unlock
- Mac Mini must be on **Ethernet** (pre-login SSH doesn't work over WiFi — WiFi password lives in a keychain that isn't unlocked yet)
- Pre-login SSH is **password-only** — does NOT accept SSH pubkey auth (verified empirically). Termius biometric SSH keys won't work for the unlock state, only for day-to-day SSH after boot.

**Network paths to the box:**

The Mac Mini's Tailscale daemon does NOT run pre-FileVault-unlock, so for power-outage-style recovery we need a second path to reach the LAN IP.

| Path | Use case | Reachable when Mac Mini Tailscale is offline? |
|---|---|---|
| Tailscale → `coles-mac-mini-1` | Day-to-day SSH, key-based with Touch ID | ❌ No |
| Home LAN (same network) → `192.168.8.230` | Remote unlock when home | ✅ Yes |
| Remote VPN to UDM → LAN IP | Remote unlock when away | ✅ Yes (once VPN works) |

**VPN-into-home options (need ONE of these for remote unlock when away from home):**
- **UniFi Teleport** (tried first): Built-in to UDM, WireGuard-based, uses Ubiquiti's hosted relay (no port forwarding, works behind CGNAT). **In our testing it never functioned** — phones connected to the WiFiman tunnel but no traffic reached the LAN, and devices never appeared in the UniFi client list. Status: deferred / probably broken on our UDM build.
- **WireGuard VPN Server on UDM** (fallback plan): Settings → VPN → VPN Server → WireGuard. Requires a port-forward (one UDP port) and either a static WAN IP or DDNS. More setup, but reliable and doesn't depend on Ubiquiti's relay.
- **Tailscale subnet router on a second always-on device** (third option): e.g. a Raspberry Pi advertising `192.168.8.0/24` to the tailnet — gives you LAN access via Tailscale even when the Mac Mini is offline.

**Power outage flow (validated end state):**
1. Power returns → Mac Mini boots → halts at FileVault unlock
2. **From phone (Termius)**: tap saved host → Termius auto-sends puddles' password to FV pre-boot stub → disk unlocks → Termius auto-reconnects to real sshd ~45s later → tap saved snippet `unlock-self.sh` → tap "Send Password" when the script prompts → script drives localhost VNC (Apple ARD auth + keystroke injection) to log puddles into the GUI session → snippet's "close session after running" closes Termius
3. **From MacBook (alternative)**: run `scripts/mac-mini/unlock.sh` → enter puddles' password once → script does both steps end-to-end
4. GUI session persists until next reboot. Disk was encrypted at rest the entire time.

### 6.2.2 — Operational tradeoffs and mitigations

The two-step unlock is friction. Mitigations:

**1. UPS (uninterruptible power supply) — strongly recommended**
- A small UPS (~$80–150, e.g. APC Back-UPS 600VA / CyberPower CP685AVR) gives 10–15 min runtime
- Most home power blips are <30s, so the UPS holds → Mac Mini never reboots → zero unlocks needed
- Long outages: UPS triggers graceful shutdown via USB signal (`pmset -a halfdim 1` + macOS UPS settings); on power return, two-step unlock required
- Reduces unplanned-unlock frequency from "every short blip" to "long outages only" (~1-2x/year)
- Bonus: clean shutdown protects the SSD from corruption

**2. Planned reboots use `fdesetup authrestart` — zero unlock**
- For macOS updates and any user-initiated reboot, stage the FV key in NVRAM so the next boot auto-unlocks AND macOS treats it as a console login by puddles → boots straight to his desktop, GUI session and all
- This is what `softwareupdate --restart --user puddles --stdinpass` does internally
- Works perfectly for: monthly updates, manual reboots, scheduled maintenance
- Does NOT work for power outages (can't pre-stage a key for an event you didn't anticipate)

**3. MacBook one-command unlock script — VALIDATED**
- Located at `scripts/mac-mini/unlock.sh` in this repo
- Single password prompt (puddles account); password never echoed or written to disk
- Step 1: `expect`-driven SSH to FV pre-boot stub for disk unlock (with diagnostic logging that doesn't expose the password; aborts cleanly on bad password / timeout / permission denied)
- Step 2: VNC connect to the Mini using **Apple ARD authentication** (Diffie-Hellman scheme 30) via `vncdotool`, then RFB keystroke injection (password + enter) into loginwindow after an 8-second pre-type sleep so the password field is focused
- ARD auth means we do NOT need "VNC viewers may control screen with password" enabled — disable that setting on the Mini; it's not used
- Requires `/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --user vncdotool` on the runner machine
- Why the AppleScript-driving-Screen-Sharing.app approach was abandoned: focus race conditions caused the typed password to leak into the foreground app (Terminal). Raw RFB via vncdotool has no app focus involved — keystrokes go straight to the loginwindow over the VNC channel.

**4. iPhone one-tap (Termius) — VALIDATED**
- Same architecture as MacBook script, but the VNC step runs **on the Mini itself** instead of on the phone — eliminates the need for a-Shell, Jump Desktop, or any Python on iOS.
- One-time install on the Mini:
  - As puddles: `git clone` the repo, `python3 -m pip install --user vncdotool`
  - As cole (sudo required): `sudo install -m 0755 .../scripts/mac-mini/unlock-self.sh /usr/local/bin/unlock-self.sh`
- Termius setup on phone:
  - Save host `puddles@coles-mac-mini-1` with password stored in Termius keychain (Face-ID gated)
  - Create Snippet "Unlock Mini" with body `unlock-self.sh` and "Close session after running" enabled
- Per-reboot UX: open Termius → tap host → tap snippet → tap "Send Password" when the script prompts → done. Termius transparently handles the FV pre-boot SSH stub and reconnect to real sshd, so it looks like one continuous SSH session to the user.
- Why this works: once FV is unlocked, the Mini's sshd runs as root and accepts normal logins regardless of GUI state. The unlock-self script connects to `localhost::5900` via Apple ARD auth and injects keystrokes into its own loginwindow. macOS doesn't care that the VNC keystroke source is the same machine.

**5. Why not just disable FileVault?**
- APFS hardware encryption (Secure Enclave key) is always on, so disk extraction from a powered-off Mac is already protected
- The only marginal protection FileVault adds is against a sophisticated attacker who has stolen the powered-off Mac AND has the chops to bypass APFS HW key extraction
- For a stationary house server: low threat. Disabling FV would eliminate ALL unlock friction (auto-login becomes possible)
- We've chosen to keep FV ON for defense-in-depth, accepting the operational cost. Revisit if friction proves untenable

### 6.3 — Exec approvals config
- Per-agent command allowlists in `exec-approvals.json`
- `security: "allowlist"` + `ask: "on-miss"` — unlisted commands prompt Cole via Telegram
- Main agent: broader allowlist
- Restricted agents: minimal allowlist

### 6.4 — Inbound content pipeline
- Two-stage preprocessing: injection detection + secret scrubbing

### 6.5 — Security audit agent
- Cron-based isolated agent reviewing daily activity

### 6.6 — Backup (data only; system is reinstallable)

**Scope:** we accept full Mac wipes. We protect *data we can't reproduce* — Apple PIM, message history, agent state/logs/configs. We do NOT protect installed apps, brew packages, system settings (all rebuildable from the plan + scripts).

**Install vs. data convention (use this for every component we install):**
- **Install / code** lives in `~/git/<project>/` — cloned from GitHub, regeneratable
- **Runtime data / workspace** lives in `~/Documents/<project>/` — backed up by iCloud Drive
- Most tools support `--data-dir`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, or an env var to redirect their workspace. When we install each component (OpenClaw, BlueBubbles, etc.) we'll point its data dir at `~/Documents/<project>/`. Fallback if no such knob: symlink `~/.<project>` → `~/Documents/<project>`.

**Backup mechanism — iCloud, all under puddles' Apple ID:**

| Data | Mechanism | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Apple Notes / Calendar / Reminders / Contacts | iCloud (built-in app sync) | None — automatic once signed in |
| iMessage history (BlueBubbles' source data) | iCloud Messages | Toggle Messages in iCloud on |
| App data we generate (OpenClaw state, BlueBubbles config exports, etc.) | iCloud Drive — Desktop & Documents Folders | Toggle Desktop & Documents Folders on |

**One-time setup (GUI on the Mini, via VNC, as puddles):**
1. System Settings → top → Sign in to Apple ID → puddles' Apple ID + 2FA
2. System Settings → Apple Account → iCloud → iCloud Drive → On → Options → Desktop & Documents Folders → On
3. Same panel → Messages in iCloud → On
4. Verify: `ls -la ~/Documents` shows the iCloud-mobiledocuments path

## Phase 7: Operational Tooling (Puddles-managed)

These are deferred until Puddles is running — he manages his own host.

### 7.1 — macOS update notifier
- Periodic check (`softwareupdate -l`)
- When updates are available, Puddles posts to your DM channel:
  - "macOS 26.x.y available: [release notes link]. Reply 'install' to apply."
- On approval: triggers the unattended update workflow (see 6.1.1)
- Lobster approval gate before reboot for safety

### 7.2 — Heartbeat / health monitoring
- Puddles posts a daily summary: uptime, disk usage, agent status, last successful boot
- Alert if subsystems (BlueBubbles, OpenClaw services) are down
- External heartbeat (cron → ntfy.sh) as backup for "Puddles himself is down"

---

## Security Architecture

### Account Model
- **Two-account separation**: admin (cole) handles system management; standard (puddles) runs all agent services
- **Admin account has no Apple ID** — removed after initial setup to eliminate personal data from the machine. If the agent account (puddles) is compromised via prompt injection and escalates privileges, there is no sensitive personal data in the admin account to exfiltrate
- **Standard account cannot sudo** — Homebrew installs and system config changes require Screen Sharing into the admin account. This is intentional friction
- **Full Disk Access is per-app, not per-user** — granting FDA to BlueBubbles does NOT give the puddles shell or other apps FDA. Each app must be explicitly added in System Settings

### SIP Disabled — Risk Acceptance
- SIP (System Integrity Protection) is disabled to enable BlueBubbles Private API
- **With SIP off, root can modify TCC.db** (the database controlling per-app permissions like Full Disk Access)
- Attack chain: prompt injection → code execution → privilege escalation to root → modify TCC.db → grant FDA to malicious process
- **Mitigations**: exec approvals (allowlisted commands only), Docker sandbox for untrusted code, Tailscale ACLs preventing lateral movement, network isolation via VLAN, admin account has no sensitive data
- If BlueBubbles Private API is not needed, SIP can stay enabled (basic iMessage send/receive still works)

### Network Security
- **VLAN isolation**: Dedicated "Puddles-Pond" (192.168.8.0/24) on UniFi Dream Machine
- **Local firewall**: Ports 22 and 5900 CLOSED on LAN — all management via Tailscale tunnel only
- **Tailscale ACLs**: Agent tagged as `tag:agent`, personal devices can reach agent, agent CANNOT reach personal devices (no outbound grant)
- **Tailscale SSH**: Replaces macOS sshd for remote access. Browser-based check on first connection per session
- **Screen Sharing**: Accessible only via Tailscale (`vnc://coles-mac-mini-1`)
- **BlueBubbles**: localhost only (127.0.0.1), never exposed to network
- **Telegram**: long polling (outbound only), no inbound ports needed
- **Outbound**: Internet allowed (LLM APIs, Telegram, Apple services, Google, web)
- **Inbound from internet**: All blocked

### Secrets Management
- macOS Keychain + OpenClaw SecretRef — no plaintext API keys on disk
- SSH private keys in Secure Enclave (hardware-bound, cannot be extracted)
- Never pass passwords through AI assistant sessions — use Screen Sharing for sudo operations

### Tailscale ACL Policy
```json
{
  "grants": [
    {"src": ["autogroup:member"], "dst": ["autogroup:self"], "ip": ["*"]},
    {"src": ["autogroup:member"], "dst": ["tag:agent"], "ip": ["*"]},
  ],
  "ssh": [
    {"action": "check", "src": ["autogroup:member"], "dst": ["autogroup:self"], "users": ["autogroup:nonroot", "root"]},
    {"action": "check", "src": ["autogroup:member"], "dst": ["tag:agent"], "users": ["autogroup:nonroot", "root"]},
  ],
  "tagOwners": {"tag:agent": ["autogroup:admin"]},
}
```

## Gotchas & Lessons Learned

1. **Homebrew requires admin** — install under the admin account, not the standard account. Both accounts can use brew after install
2. **Tailscale: use Homebrew CLI, NOT App Store** — the App Store version is sandboxed and cannot host SSH
3. **Tailscale: use `sudo brew services start` for LaunchDaemon** — `brew services start` (without sudo) creates a LaunchAgent that only runs when the user is logged in. The sudo version creates a system LaunchDaemon that starts at boot
4. **Tailscale: disable key expiry** for always-on servers — default 180-day expiry will silently disconnect the machine
5. **Tailscale: auto-update not supported on Homebrew** — set up a weekly `brew upgrade` job. Implemented as a system LaunchDaemon at `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cole.brew-autoupdate.plist` running as the cole user (cole owns `/opt/homebrew`). Sundays at 03:00 local. See `scripts/mac-mini/`.
6. **Killing the manual tailscaled before starting brew service** — if you test with a manual `tailscaled &`, kill it before switching to the brew service or they'll conflict
7. **Re-authentication needed after daemon restart** — switching from manual to brew service daemon loses the auth state. Run `sudo tailscale up --ssh` again
8. **Secure Enclave SSH keys use ECDSA P-256, not Ed25519** — macOS Secure Enclave doesn't support Ed25519. The `ed25519-sk` approach (FIDO2) is NOT supported by Apple's built-in OpenSSH
9. **`sc_auth create-ctk-identity`** is the correct tool for Secure Enclave keys, not `ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk`
10. **Never pass passwords through AI assistant sessions** — they get logged to events.jsonl. Use Screen Sharing for any sudo/password operations
11. **HDMI dummy plug recommended** — without it, Screen Sharing may show a blank screen on a headless Mac Mini
12. **FileVault + auto-login are mutually exclusive on Apple Silicon** — both the GUI and `sysadminctl -autologin set` refuse with *"Automatic login is disabled because FileVault is enabled"*. Architecture: two-step unlock — Termius (SSH for FV disk unlock) + VNC (loginwindow for GUI session). Plan service layout accordingly (LaunchDaemons for always-on, puddles' LaunchAgents for things needing his GUI session)
13. **Pre-login SSH unlock does NOT log a user in** — it only unlocks the FileVault-encrypted disk so boot can continue to loginwindow. Verified empirically post-unlock: `who` empty, `/dev/console` owned by root, `launchctl print gui/<uid>` returns "Domain does not support specified action". A separate VNC login at loginwindow is required to start a real GUI session and fire per-user LaunchAgents
14. **Pre-login SSH (Tahoe 26) is password-only** — does NOT accept pubkey auth. Termius biometric SSH keys help with day-to-day SSH but not the unlock state. Verified empirically with `ssh -v` — server jumps straight to password prompt
14. **UniFi inter-VLAN port lists are quirky** — the LAN-In rule "Port" field accepts comma-separated lists (`22,5900`) and ranges (`22-5900`) in the UI but doesn't always parse them correctly. In our testing port 22 worked but 5900 didn't with a `22-5900` range. Safest pattern: one rule per port, OR a port group with each port listed individually
15. **UniFi Teleport unreliable** — connected but no LAN traffic flowed in our testing. WireGuard VPN Server on UDM is the more reliable fallback
16. **Lock screen vs. headless server** — counterintuitively, you DO want screen lock enabled even on a headless box. Background launchd jobs run regardless of lock state, and the lock protects the physical machine if anyone walks up
17. **Tahoe removed the GUI "Restart automatically if the computer freezes" toggle** — and `sudo systemsetup -setrestartfreeze on` returns error -99 unless Terminal has Full Disk Access. Apple Silicon auto-restarts on kernel panic by default; this flag only matters for soft hangs and is not worth the FDA dance for most setups
18. **`bputil -E` does not exist** — true MDM-style "Recovery Lock" is not exposed to non-MDM users. FileVault provides equivalent Recovery / wipe protection automatically (owner credential required)
19. **macOS Screen Sharing offers Apple ARD auth (Diffie-Hellman scheme 30) FIRST in the auth list** — a generic VNC client like vncdotool will pick it and require a username (not just a VNC password). Provide both `username=` and `password=` to vncdotool's `api.connect()` for ARD. As a side benefit, ARD obviates needing the "VNC viewers may control screen with password" setting
20. **Self-VNC works** — once FV is unlocked and sshd is up, the Mini can SSH in to itself (well, anything can SSH in) and connect to its OWN `localhost::5900` to drive its own loginwindow. macOS doesn't care that the VNC source is the same machine. This is what `unlock-self.sh` does, and it lets the iPhone do everything from Termius alone (no Jump Desktop, no Python, no a-Shell needed on the phone)
21. **Loginwindow needs ~5–8 seconds after VNC connect before the password field is focused** — typing too quickly drops keystrokes silently. Sleep at least 8s post-connect before typing
22. **`os._exit(0)` skips Python's stdout flush** — print messages can be swallowed by piped consumers. Use `print(..., flush=True)` if you need to confirm progress before _exit (which we do to work around vncdotool's twisted reactor not shutting down cleanly)
23. **expect with `>/dev/null 2>&1` hides everything** — including auth failures. Use `log_user 0` + `puts` for safe milestone logging that doesn't leak the password. Add explicit `denied|incorrect|failed|Permission denied|timeout` patterns to fail fast on bad input instead of marching on against a still-locked disk
24. **Homebrew is owned by whoever installed it** — `/opt/homebrew` is writable only by that user (cole, since cole is admin). Anything that runs `brew upgrade` MUST run as that user or it'll hit `Permission denied`. For automated jobs, use a system LaunchDaemon with `<key>UserName</key><string>cole</string>`, not a per-user LaunchAgent under puddles
25. **Install vs. data convention** — install/code in `~/git/<project>/`, runtime data in `~/Documents/<project>/`. iCloud Drive (Desktop & Documents Folders) backs up `~/Documents/`, so anything we put there is safe across full Mac wipes. Apply this when configuring every component (point its `--data-dir`/env var at `~/Documents/<project>/`, or symlink `~/.<project>` → `~/Documents/<project>`)
26. **macOS Keychain prompts are invisible to LaunchAgents** — `keytar.getPassword()` (used by mcp-hooks) blocks indefinitely if the keychain entry's ACL doesn't already trust the calling binary. The OS shows a "Keychain Access" prompt, but it only renders in the foreground GUI of whoever is currently logged in — the LaunchAgent has no UI surface to present it on. Symptom: `gateway.err.log` shows `token_refresh_start` with no matching `token_refresh_done` for minutes; the wrapped tool call wedges. Empirically you'll get **two** prompts (one labelled "openclaw gateway", one labelled "node") because the gateway and helper subprocesses resolve to two different node-binary paths for ACL purposes. Fix: always create keychain entries with `-T /opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin/node -T /opt/homebrew/bin/node` (see `docs/openclaw-setup/04-secure-gmail.md` §7) so both paths can read them without a prompt. For existing entries, use `security set-generic-password-partition-list` to update the ACL without recreating.

## Inter-Agent Communication (Lobster Approval Gates)

When Group Puddles needs Main Puddles to take action on your behalf, requests go through the Lobster workflow plugin — not direct agent-to-agent messaging.

### How it works
1. Group Puddles detects an actionable request from the group chat (calendar event, reminder, email, etc.)
2. Instead of messaging Main Puddles directly, it kicks off a Lobster workflow
3. **Step 1**: Format the request into a structured payload
4. **Step 2**: Approval gate — you get a prompt in your DM asking to approve or deny
5. **Step 3**: Only if you approve, the request gets delivered to Main Puddles and the action executes

### Why this matters
- Main Puddles never even processes the request unless you've approved it
- No one in a group chat can put stuff on your calendar, set reminders, or trigger actions without your explicit tap
- The approval is enforced by the Lobster runtime, not by AI instructions — it physically can't skip the gate

### Security layers (belt + suspenders + a third belt)
- **Layer 1**: Group agent has no calendar/exec tools at all (system-enforced tool policy)
- **Layer 2**: Lobster approval gate blocks the request from reaching Main Puddles (runtime-enforced)
- **Layer 3**: Exec approvals on Main Puddles gate the actual CLI execution (system-enforced)

### Dependencies
- Lobster CLI installed on Mac Mini (brew or npm)
- Lobster plugin enabled for the group agent
- Approval prompts forwarded to Telegram/iMessage DM

## Phase 8: Multiplayer (post-MVP — beyond just Cole)

The single-user MVP assumes only Cole talks to Puddles. Onboarding additional people (family, friends) requires a few extra pieces.

### 8.1 — Scripted contact onboarding
**Goal:** one command to onboard a new person — adds them to puddles' Contacts.app (so they see Puddles' shared name + photo) AND adds their handle(s) to `channels.bluebubbles.allowFrom` (so they can actually message the agent). Currently both steps are manual + separate.

Open questions:
- AppleScript / Contacts.framework Swift CLI to add contact entries to puddles' local Contacts (no first-class CLI exists; AppleScript via Contacts.app works but needs Automation TCC grant)
- Sync vs one-shot? (See Apple's lack of native iCloud Contacts sharing between Apple IDs.) Likely one-shot per-person via CLI, since cole↔puddles iCloud Contacts can't sync natively.
- Possible future: secondary iCloud account on Mac Mini for cole's contacts (Internet Accounts → cole's Apple ID, Contacts only) for live sync. Defers the per-person script to a single account-level setup.

Sketch:
```bash
puddles-onboard "+15551234567" "Friend Name" friend@icloud.com
# → adds Contacts.app entry via osascript
# → adds both handles to channels.bluebubbles.allowFrom
```

### 8.2 — Per-person memory / context isolation
Open question: does each onboarded person get their own thread / soul slice, or all share one global Puddles context?

### 8.3 — Per-person tool gates
Some tools (calendar write, money moves, smart home) should never be available to non-Cole users.
