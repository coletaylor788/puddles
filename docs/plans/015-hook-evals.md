# Plan 015: Hook Evals

**Status:** Phase 1 complete (2026-04-25); Phases 2-3 deferred  
**Created:** 2026-04-13  
**Depends on:** Plan 009 (MCP Security Hooks Library)

## Summary

Build an eval suite for the four LLM-powered hooks (LeakGuard secrets, LeakGuard sensitive, LeakGuard PII, InjectionGuard) and the LLM phase of SecretRedactor. Evals measure classification accuracy against curated datasets, run locally as part of the test suite, and produce precision/recall/F1 scores per hook.

## Why Evals (Not Just Unit Tests)

Unit tests verify code logic with mocked LLM responses. Evals verify **prompt quality** against real (or realistic) LLM calls. When we tune prompts, evals tell us if accuracy improved or regressed. They're the feedback loop for prompt engineering.

## What Gets Eval'd

Each LLM-powered classification is a separate eval:

| Eval | Hook | Task | Expected output |
|------|------|------|----------------|
| `secrets` | LeakGuard | Does content contain secrets? | yes/no |
| `sensitive` | LeakGuard | Does content contain specific personal financial/medical data? | yes/no |
| `pii` | LeakGuard | Does content contain PII? | yes/no |
| `injection` | InjectionGuard | Does content contain prompt injection? | yes/no |
| `redact` | SecretRedactor | What secrets are present? Return exact strings + types | list of `{ secret, type }` |

## Eval Dataset Design

### Structure

Each eval case is:
```typescript
interface EvalCase {
  id: string;                    // unique identifier
  content: string;               // the text to classify
  expected: boolean;             // true = should detect, false = should not
  category: string;              // subcategory for analysis (e.g., "api_key", "jwt", "general_inquiry")
  difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard";
  notes?: string;                // why this case is interesting
}
```

For SecretRedactor:
```typescript
interface RedactEvalCase {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  expected_redactions: Array<{ secret: string; type: string }>;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### Dataset Size Targets

Target 1K+ per eval. Final count depends on category coverage — if a thorough taxonomy yields 40 categories × 30 cases each = 1,200, that's better than forcing 500/500 with thin categories.

| Eval | Target | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| secrets | 1,000+ | ~equal positive/negative split |
| sensitive | 1,000+ | Heavy on hard negatives (general vs specific) |
| pii | 1,000+ | ~equal split |
| injection | 1,500+ | Largest set — most diverse attack surface |
| redact | 500+ | Positive-only (each case has expected redactions) |

### Dataset Generation Strategy

**Model:** Opus for generation (highest quality, best diversity within categories).

**Approach:** Define a thorough category taxonomy per eval FIRST, then generate N cases per category. Each category gets its own generation prompt with specific examples and guidance. This ensures structural diversity — you can't get it by asking an LLM to "generate 500 diverse cases."

**Per category:** Generate ~equal cases, then top up underrepresented categories. Each category produces both positive AND negative cases where applicable.

### Cross-Cutting Dimensions

For ALL eval categories above, cases should also vary across these dimensions to ensure robustness:

| Dimension | Variants |
|-----------|----------|
| **Content length** | One-liner, short paragraph (2-3 sentences), full email (200-500 words), long document (1000+ words) |
| **Format** | Plain text, markdown, HTML email, JSON, YAML, XML, code (Python/JS/Go), shell output, log output, CSV |
| **Language** | English (primary), Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, mixed multilingual |
| **Tone** | Formal business, casual chat, technical documentation, automated notification, urgent/emotional |
| **Source context** | Email body, chat message, search query, CLI output, API response, web page, git commit/diff, config file |
| **Difficulty** | Easy (obvious patterns), medium (realistic but detectable), hard (adversarial, subtle, ambiguous) |

### Generation Process

For each eval, for each category:
1. Write a focused Opus prompt for that specific category
2. Generate **15 cases per category** (5 easy + 5 medium + 5 hard)
3. Cross-cut with dimension variety within each category (vary length, format, language, tone, source context)
4. Review generated cases for quality and realism
5. Deduplicate and verify no category is underrepresented
6. Tag each case with category, difficulty, and cross-cutting dimensions for analysis

**Estimated totals at 15 cases × categories:**

| Eval | Categories | Est. cases |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| secrets | ~85 | ~1,275 |
| sensitive | ~76 | ~1,140 |
| pii | ~65 | ~975 |
| injection | ~95 | ~1,425 |
| redact | ~35 | ~525 |
| **Total** | | **~5,340** |

## Running Evals

### Local Execution

Evals run as a separate test command — not part of the normal `vitest` unit test suite since they make real LLM calls:

```bash
# Run all evals
pnpm eval

# Run specific eval
pnpm eval:secrets
pnpm eval:injection

# Run with verbose output (shows each case)
pnpm eval --verbose
```

Implementation: a simple script that loads the dataset, runs each case through the hook, compares to expected, and computes scores.

```typescript
// eval-runner.ts
for (const evalCase of dataset) {
  const result = await hook.check("test_tool", evalCase.content);
  const actual = result.action === "block";
  scores.push({
    id: evalCase.id,
    expected: evalCase.expected,
    actual,
    correct: actual === evalCase.expected,
    category: evalCase.category,
    difficulty: evalCase.difficulty,
  });
}
```

### Scoring

**Primary metrics per eval:**

| Metric | What it measures | Target |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Precision** | Of things flagged, how many were real? | ≥ 95% |
| **Recall** | Of real issues, how many were caught? | ≥ 90% |
| **F1** | Harmonic mean of precision/recall | ≥ 92% |
| **False positive rate** | Of clean content, how much was wrongly flagged? | ≤ 5% |

**Why precision ≥ 95%:** False positives are worse than false negatives for UX. A hook that cries wolf kills user trust and creates approval fatigue. Better to miss a rare edge case than block legitimate work constantly.

**Why recall ≥ 90%:** We still want strong detection — missing 1 in 10 real issues is the acceptable floor.

**Breakdown by category and difficulty:**
```
secrets eval:
  Overall: P=96% R=92% F1=94%
  By category:
    api_key:     P=98% R=95%  (easy)
    jwt:         P=95% R=88%  (medium)
    embedded:    P=93% R=85%  (hard)
  By difficulty:
    easy:   F1=97%
    medium: F1=93%
    hard:   F1=88%
```

### Output Format

Each eval run produces a JSON report:
```json
{
  "eval": "secrets",
  "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-13T...",
  "total": 100,
  "correct": 94,
  "precision": 0.96,
  "recall": 0.92,
  "f1": 0.94,
  "false_positives": ["case-47", "case-82"],
  "false_negatives": ["case-15", "case-33", "case-91"],
  "by_category": { ... },
  "by_difficulty": { ... }
}
```

Reports saved to `packages/mcp-hooks/evals/results/` (gitignored) for comparison across prompt iterations.

### Cost and Time Estimates

- ~5,300 cases × 1 LLM call each = ~5,300 Haiku calls
- Haiku is fast (~200ms/call) and cheap
- Parallel execution (batches of 20-50): ~20-30 minutes total
- Cost: negligible on a LLM provider plan

## Prompt Iteration Workflow

1. Run evals → see baseline scores
2. Examine false positives and false negatives
3. Adjust the system prompt
4. Re-run evals → compare scores
5. Repeat until targets met
6. Commit prompt + eval results together

## Checklist

This plan is being delivered in **3 phases**. Phases 1 and 2a are complete;
Phases 2b and 3 are deferred.

### Phase 1 — harness + seed datasets + baseline (✅ 2026-04-25)

#### Refactor: prompt centralization
- [x] Centralize all 5 LLM prompts in `packages/mcp-hooks/src/prompts.ts` (single source of truth, internal)
- [x] Extract `classifyBoolean()` helper into `src/classify.ts` with explicit `outcome: ok|parse_error|api_error`
- [x] Refactor `LeakGuard`, `InjectionGuard`, `SendApproval`, `SecretRedactor` to use centralized prompts + helper
- [x] Discovered + fixed silent prompt drift: `SENSITIVE_PROMPT` differed by one example phrase between `leak-guard.ts` and `send-approval.ts` (LeakGuard's richer wording adopted as canonical)
- [x] All 95 mcp-hooks unit tests still pass post-refactor
- [x] Lint + build clean

#### Eval harness
- [x] `evals/types.ts` — shared types (BooleanEvalCase, RedactEvalCase, EvalReport, etc.)
- [x] `evals/load.ts` — case loader with `content_b64` decode for secret-shaped fixtures
- [x] `evals/classifiers.ts` — `makeBooleanClassifier`, `runRedact` (end-to-end through `SecretRedactor.check`)
- [x] `evals/scoring.ts` — precision/recall/F1/FPR with `low_sample_size` warning at n<10
- [x] `evals/runner.ts` — concurrency control, retry+backoff, timeout, two-view metrics, sha256 hashes for prompt + dataset, git SHA in report
- [x] `evals/cli.ts` — argv parser, all-eval orchestration, sanitized summary, PAT-skip pattern
- [x] `pnpm eval` scripts in `package.json` (eval, eval:secrets, eval:sensitive, eval:pii, eval:injection, eval:redact)
- [x] `tsx` devDep added
- [x] `evals/.gitignore` — ignores `results/` (raw scratch outputs)

#### Seed datasets (Phase 1 — small, hand-curated)
- [x] `evals/datasets/secrets.json` — 30 cases (17 positive, 13 negative)
- [x] `evals/datasets/sensitive.json` — 25 cases (12 positive, 13 negative)
- [x] `evals/datasets/pii.json` — 25 cases (12 positive, 13 negative)
- [x] `evals/datasets/injection.json` — 25 cases (15 positive, 10 negative)
- [x] `evals/datasets/redact.json` — 20 cases (15 positive, 5 negative)
- [x] Secret-scanning hardening: `.github/secret_scanning.yml` excludes `evals/datasets/**` and `evals/baselines/**`; secret-shaped fixtures stored as `content_b64`

#### Baseline run (claude-haiku-4-5, 2026-04-25)

- [x] Baselines committed to `packages/mcp-hooks/evals/baselines/`
- [x] Each report includes git SHA + prompt hash + dataset hash for reproducibility

#### Documentation
- [x] `evals/README.md` — methodology, two metric views, how to run, dataset format, b64 escape hatch, phased scope
- [x] Plan marked complete (this file)

#### Phase 1 callouts for later phases

- **Redact FPR is high** (~40%) — over-redaction of clean content. Top
  candidate for Phase 3 prompt tuning.
- **Per-category metrics tagged `low_sample_size`** — Phase 1 datasets are
  intentionally small. Per-category numbers are diagnostic, not headline.
- **Production-semantics view** treats infra failures as fail-open negatives
  (matching real behavior). Compare to **valid-only view** to separate prompt
  quality from infra reliability.

### Phase 2 — full datasets

#### Phase 2a (n≈500 per eval) — **DONE 2026-04-29**

Generated synthetic datasets with `claude-opus-4.7` + independent
LLM validation:

| Eval      | Total | Seed | Generated | Reject% | F1 (validOnly) | Precision | Recall | FPR   |
|-----------|------:|-----:|----------:|--------:|---------------:|----------:|-------:|------:|
| secrets   |   529 |   30 |       499 |    13%  |          0.930 |     0.935 |  0.924 | 0.072 |
| sensitive |   525 |   25 |       500 |    58%  |          0.925 |     0.979 |  0.877 | 0.019 |
| pii       |   525 |   25 |       500 |    53%  |          0.979 |     0.960 |  1.000 | 0.042 |
| injection |   509 |   25 |       484 |     2%  |          1.000 |     1.000 |  1.000 | 0.000 |
| redact    |   215 |   20 |       195 |     7%  |          0.929 |     0.867 |  1.000 | 0.354 |

Pipeline: `evals/generate.ts` + `evals/generate-config.ts`. For each
case: round-robin (category × intended label) → Opus generation
(temp=0.9) → dedup-by-hash → independent validator prompt
(temp=0, max_tokens=5, NOT the production prompt) → auto-base64 if
content matches a credential regex.

Notes:
- Statistical signal much stronger than Phase 1 (n=25-30 → n=500).
- Sensitive and PII have ~50% validation reject rates — generator
  occasionally drifts off-label; validator catches it. Kept cases all
  passed independent validation.
- Redact FPR still 0.354 (Phase 1 was 0.40). Confirms over-redaction
  is a real prompt issue, not seed-set artifact. → Phase 3 target.
- Injection F1=1.0 (validOnly) suggests the Phase 1 prompt is already
  near-saturated for this taxonomy. May want harder edge cases in 2b.
- Phase 1 seed cases are preserved at `evals/datasets/seeds/<eval>.json`.

#### Phase 2b — scale to 5K+/eval (deferred)

Same pipeline; bump `totalTarget` in `evals/generate-config.ts`.
Expected wall time: ~5-10× Phase 2a (~hours, not days).

- [ ] Bump per-eval targets, re-run generator
- [ ] Per-category metrics with statistically meaningful per-cell n
- [ ] Stratified sampling for cross-cutting dimensions (length, tone, format)
- [ ] Optional: human review of N=50 spot-check sample per eval

### Phase 3 — prompt iteration (deferred)

- [ ] Identify and analyze false positives and false negatives from Phase 2 baseline
- [ ] Focus on redact FPR (over-redaction) as highest-priority target
- [ ] Iterate on prompts until targets met (P ≥ 95%, R ≥ 90%, F1 ≥ 92%)
- [ ] Document final prompt versions and scores
- [ ] Compare against Phase 1 baseline to verify no regressions on small set
