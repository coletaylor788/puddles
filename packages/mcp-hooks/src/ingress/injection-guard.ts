/**
 * Optional transform that scopes which slice of the tool's response is sent
 * to the prompt-injection LLM classifier.
 *
 * The plugin owns the structure of its tool output (which fields are
 * structural envelope vs which are user/attacker-controlled free-text
 * payload), and is therefore the right layer to decide which substring(s)
 * the classifier should judge. Returning a narrower slice both focuses the
 * model on the high-signal surface (e.g. email `body`/`subject`, calendar
 * `notes`) and reduces false positives on benign envelope fields.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - Receives the raw content from the tool response.
 *   - Returns the substring to scan; may be empty (skips the LLM call,
 *     allows the response through).
 *   - Must be synchronous and side-effect free.
 *
 * Security boundary: this is a SCOPING knob, not an authorization knob.
 * Anything excluded from the returned slice is NOT scanned for prompt
 * injection. Plugin authors must therefore only exclude content they trust
 * to be structural envelope (e.g. opaque object IDs, server-set status
 * fields), never user/attacker-controlled payload. No auto-default is
 * provided — the hook can't tell trusted envelope from untrusted payload
 * by inspection alone.
