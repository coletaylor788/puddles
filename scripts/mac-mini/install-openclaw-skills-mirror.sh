# One-time installer (run as the user who owns the OpenClaw workspace, e.g.
# `puddles` on the mini; no sudo required).
#
# - Installs mirror-openclaw-skills.sh to ~/.local/bin
# - Installs the LaunchAgent into ~/Library/LaunchAgents (per-user, since
#   ~/.openclaw and ~/.npm-global are user-scoped)
# - Bootstraps the agent into the user's launchd domain
# - Runs the mirror once synchronously so the workspace is populated before
#   the gateway hits its first prompt cycle
